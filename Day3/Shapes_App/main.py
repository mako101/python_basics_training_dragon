# Draw a class diagram of the case study below
# Using Inheritance, create an application that allows users to calculate the area, perimeter and circumference where necessary
# for a circle, triangle and rectangle
# The application should ask the users which shape they intend to calculate
# for rectangle, the system should calculate area and perimeter using the rectangle formula
# for triangle, the system should calculate area and triangle using the triangle formula
# for circle, the system should calculate area and circumference using the circle formula

# handle all exceptions where necessary
# Use Google to get the formulas where necessary
